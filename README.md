 # Project 1: Facial Keypoints detection

* This project is all about defining and training a convolutional neural network to perform facial keypoint detection, and using computer vision techniques to transform images of faces.
* This set of image data has been extracted from the YouTube Faces Dataset, which includes videos of people in YouTube videos.
* These videos have been fed through some processing steps and turned into sets of image frames containing one face and the associated keypoints.
* This facial keypoints dataset consists of 5770 color images. All of these images are separated into either a training or a test set of data.

* 3462 of these images are training images and 2308 are test images
* The information about the images and keypoints in this dataset are summarized in CSV files,
* Sample Results
